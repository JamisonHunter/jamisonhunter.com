# About

Welcome! Some of the projects that I make are small enough that they don't really warrant an entire Github repo. Others just wouldn't suit that format. This is what my blog is for! I tend to work with the following technologies.

- Python
- Rust
- Arduino
- Linux

It varies as I mess around with stuff. Anyway, have a look around!
