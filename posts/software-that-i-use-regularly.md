# Software That I Use Regularly

*October 1, 2025*

If I've learned anything about being on the internet long enough, it's that there's a lot of shockingly bad proprietary software out there and a lot of surprisingly good free solutions. These are the softwares that I use quite often. I wouldn't call myself a power user necessarily. I just like whatever allows me to get things done somewhat efficiently and in a user friendly way. 

This obviously isn't all of the software that I use. This is what I thought was notable. I also don't claim to be any sort of expert with this software. I can get stuff done with it and that's all that I need!

## Operating Systems

- **Arch Linux**
- **Pop!_OS**
- **Ubuntu**

Okay I feel like this requires some explaining. Why did I list three different operating systems? Well, it depends on what I'm trying to do. I use Arch Linux on my main desktop computer because it offers the customization and ease of aquiring new software that I need. The package manager is absolutely incredible and the system runs insanely well. But I would never recommend Arch to anybody new to linux systems or to people who want something that doesn't require sustomization. I don't always want intense customization, which is where my other options come in. 

Pop!_OS is pretty interesting because I'd say it's one of the best linux systems for gaming. Really, as much as it pains me to say, if you want a dedicated gaming PC, just use Windows. However, if you want a reasonably simple system to install for light gaming and an NVIDIA GPU, I would highly recommend Pop!_OS. Yes that's rather specific but some people have specific needs. The included shop application is also pretty solid when it isn't freezing. 

What about Ubuntu? Well, my use case for that is pretty simple. If I have an old laptop that I just need to get up and running with basic programs, I'm going to install Ubuntu. It's a solid operating system that just works. Just don't use the included software store. It uses snap packages by default, which are known for being garbage. Learn how to use the apt package manager properly and you'll have a decent time. 

## Terminals

- **Tilix**
- **Cool Retro Terminal**

Tilix is fantastic. You can easily open up multiple terminal windows without any configuration. 

Cool retro terminal is exactly that. It just looks cool and retro. I do not use this for any other reason apart from looking like a cool hacker man in front of people. 

## Desktop Environment

- **GNOME**

I'd recommend trying all sorts of desktop environments. I use GNOME because of how simple the vision settings are to configure. I'm pretty blind and I found that the zoom features included with GNOME work very well for me. I also like how similar it feels to MAac computers since I grew up using Apple computers.

## Browsers 

- **Brave**
- **Mullbad Browser**

Both of these browsers are pretty decent when it comes to internet privacy and opposition towards data collection. Yeah, the corporations and governments already have plenty of data on you but it isn't a zero sum game. You can at the very least reduce the amount of free data that they can get on you. 

## Text Editing

- **LibreOffice Writer**

It's kind of like Word if Word was good. And yes, you can save files as word documents.

## IDE

- **Code - OSS**
- **Micro**

Code - OSS is basically just VS Code without Microsoft telemetry and it works great! Standard VS Code is also a very solid option if you don't care about telemetry or want more copilot integration. 

Micro is great for very small tasks or for code editing on a Raspberry Pi. I would never use it if I didn't need to but it's way better than nano. 

## Specialized IDEs

- **Arduino IDE 2**
- **OpenSCAD**

The Arduino IDE is fantastic for microcontroller projects! I mostly use Arduinos or ESP32s for my projects. I use this IDE because it offers a lot of different libraries for various electronic components. It makes microcontroller prohramming feel pretty easy once you get it set up. 

OpenSCAD is a 3D modelling software. The difference between this software and others is that it mostly involves scripting. The syntax is similar to C. For simple to intermediatre modelling tasks, this software is simply amazing! This is also the only time that I will recommend downloading it as a snap package on linux because other options are pretty unstable. On Windows you'll probably be fine. 

## VPN

- **Mullvad VPN**

This VPN is absolutely brilliant. I find that a lot of VPN companies make strange claims about being anaonymous online. They're also pretty overpriced. Mullvad VPN is very solid and does exactly what it tells you it can do. You can even pay for it in cash or Monero, which is a huge plus!

## Programming Languages

- **Python**
- **Rust**
- **TypeScript**

I use Python if there's just a script that I need to get done really quickly. I also use Python's Flask fraamework to build websites. It's simple and it just works for most tasks! 

Rust is interesting. I both love and hate this language. But I have to admit just how quick it is and how safe the language is. I use this language to build local terminal applications. 

TypeScript is the language that I use at work. I would enjoy it a lot more it it wasn't a superset of JavaScript. NPM is such an unpleasant package manager. Yet, I like the syntax of TypeScript so much! I only use this language at work or for frontend projects that require it.
